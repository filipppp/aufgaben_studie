This approach is suitable because it systematically explores each possible path of light propagation.\nQueue Management: The script manages a queue to explore each direction light can take. When light hits a splitter, multiple new directions are added to the queue.\nUnique Count: The illuminated set is used to avoid counting the same cell multiple times for the same direction, ensuring accurate counting.\nOutput: Finally, we count only those cells which represent homes (denoted by '.') and were illuminated.\nThis script should correctly calculate the number of illuminated homes based on your requirements and constraints."}},{"studyQuestions":{"pre":{"variant":"Variation 2","gender":"Male","age":22,"csFieldYears":9,"csWorkYears":3,"programmingLanguage":"Python","llmUsageFrequency":"Rarely","attitudeTowardsAI":"Highly unfavorable","leetCodeChallengeFrequency":"Rarely"},"post":{"futureUseOfLLMs":"Definitely no","additionalInputs":"","attitudeChangeOnAI":"No, it just confirmed that the generated code is useless and very hard to fix"},"task1":{"perceivedProductivity":"Agree","efficiency":"Neutral","autonomyCause":"Disagree","autonomyFreedom":"Disagree","autonomyTrueSelf":"Disagree","competenceCapable":"Neutral","competenceChallenges":"Strongly disagree","competenceTasks":"Strongly disagree","stimulationNew":"Disagree","stimulationPleasure":"Strongly disagree","stimulationType":"Disagree","meaningDevelopment":"Disagree","meaningBecoming":"Disagree","meaningUnderstanding":"Disagree","securityRoutine":"Neutral","securityStructured":"Neutral","securitySafe":"Neutral","supervisorInitial":15,"supervisorRefine":28,"supervisorTaskComplete":"Yes","promptingTechAverage":"Never use ChatGPT for development"},"task2":{"perceivedProductivity":"Neutral","efficiency":"Disagree","autonomyCause":"Disagree","autonomyFreedom":"Disagree","autonomyTrueSelf":"Strongly disagree","competenceCapable":"Disagree","competenceChallenges":"Strongly disagree","competenceTasks":"Strongly disagree","stimulationNew":"Disagree","stimulationPleasure":"Disagree","stimulationType":"Disagree","meaningDevelopment":"Strongly disagree","meaningBecoming":"Disagree","meaningUnderstanding":"Neutral","securityRoutine":"Neutral","securityStructured":"Neutral","securitySafe":"Neutral","supervisorInitial":8,"supervisorRefine":64,"supervisorTaskComplete":"No","promptingTechAverage":"Never use ChatGPT for development"}},"task1":{"userCode":"import sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(100_000)\n\ndef read_circuit(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        grid = [list(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]\n    return grid\n\ndef find_start(grid):\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == 'S':\n                return (i, j)\n    return None\n\ndef can_connect(from_tile, to_tile, direction):\n    connections = {\n        '|': {'up': ['|', 'F', '7', 'S'], 'down': ['|', 'J', 'L', 'S']},\n        '-': {'left': ['-', 'F', 'L', 'S'], 'right': ['-', 'J', '7', 'S']},\n        'L': {'up': ['|', 'F', '7', 'S'], 'right': ['-', 'J', '7', 'S']},\n        'J': {'up': ['|', 'F', '7', 'S'], 'left': ['-', 'F', 'L', 'S']},\n        'F': {'down': ['|', 'L', 'J', 'S'], 'right': ['-', 'J', '7', 'S']},\n        '7': {'down': ['|', 'L', 'J', 'S'], 'left': ['-', 'F', 'L', 'S']},\n        'S': {'up': ['|', 'F', '7'], 'left': ['-', 'F', 'L'], 'down': ['|', 'J', 'L'], 'right': ['-', 'J', '7']},\n    }\n    return direction in connections[from_tile] and to_tile in connections[from_tile][direction]\n\ndef find_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    directions = {\n        'up': (x-1, y),\n        'down': (x+1, y),\n        'left': (x, y-1),\n        'right': (x, y+1)\n    }\n    neighbors = {}\n    for direction, (nx, ny) in directions.items():\n        if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and grid[nx][ny] != '.':\n            if can_connect(grid[x][y], grid[nx][ny], direction):\n                neighbors[(nx, ny)] = direction\n    return neighbors\n\ndef dfs(grid, x, y, visited, path):\n    if (x, y) in visited:\n        if path[0] == (x, y):\n            return path  # Found a loop\n        return None\n    visited.add((x, y))\n    path.append((x, y))\n    neighbors = find_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n    for (nx, ny), direction in neighbors.items():\n        if (nx, ny) == path[len(path) -

The program needs to track the light's path, handle reflections and splitting according to the rules you've specified, and count the number of unique grid cells the light passes through until it either exits the grid or reaches a stable cycle.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to implement this:\n\nRead the Grid: Load the grid from a file, where each line corresponds to a row in the grid.\n\nSimulate the Light's Path: Initialize the starting position and direction of the light. Then, move the light according to the rules associated with each grid component it encounters:\n\n\"/\" and \"\\\" mirrors change the direction of the light.\n\"|\" and \"-\" splitters alter the path based on the direction from which the light approaches.\n\".\" allows the light to continue in its current direction.\nTracking: Use a set to keep track of all unique grid cells visited by the light to ensure that each cell is only counted once, even if the light passes through it multiple times.\n\nBoundary Conditions: Ensure the simulation stops if the light exits the bounds of the grid or potentially if it enters an infinite loop, although detecting loops can be complex.\n\nLet's start by writing this Python program.

Keep track of the maximum distance traveled from 'S' to any wire connection.\n\nCalculate the Farthest Distance: As BFS progresses, maintain a counter for the distance traveled from 'S' and update the maximum distance whenever a farther wire connection is reached.\n\nHere is how you could write this in C#:\n\npython```\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\npublic class CircuitFinder\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        string[] grid = new string[]\n        {\n            \".|F7.\",\n            \"LFJ|.\",\n            \"SJ.L7\",\n            \"|F--J\",\n            \"LJ.L.\"\n        };\n\n        Console.WriteLine(FindFarthestConnection(grid));\n    }\n\n    private static int FindFarthestConnection(string[] grid)\n    {\n        int rows = grid.Length;\n        int cols = grid[0].Length;\n        var directions = new Dictionary<char, List<(int, int)>>\n        {\n            ['|'] = new List<(int, int)> { (1, 0), (-1, 0) },\n            ['-'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, 1), (0, -1) },\n            ['L'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, 1), (-1, 0) },\n            ['J'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, -1), (-1, 0) },\n            ['F'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, 1), (1, 0) },\n            ['7'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, -1), (1, 0) }\n        };\n\n        int startX = 0, startY = 0, maxDistance = 0;\n        bool foundStart = false;\n        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)\n        {\n            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)\n            {\n                if (grid[i][j] == 'S')\n                {\n                    startX = i;\n                    startY = j;\n                    foundStart = true;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (foundStart) break;\n        }\n\n        Queue<(int, int, int)> queue = new Queue<(int, int, int)>();\n        queue.Enqueue((startX, startY, 0));\n        var visited = new HashSet<(int, int)>();\n        visited.Add((startX, startY));\n\n        while (queue.Count > 0)\n        {\n            var (x, y, dist) = queue.Dequeue();\n            foreach (var direction in directions[grid[x][y]])\n            {\n                int newX = x + direction.Item1;\n                int newY = y + direction.Item2;\n                if (newX >= 0 && newX < rows && newY >= 0 && newY < cols && !visited.Contains((newX, newY)) && directions.ContainsKey(grid[newX][newY]))\n                {\n                    visited.Add((newX, newY));\n                    queue.Enqueue((newX, newY, dist + 1));\n                    maxDistance = Math.Max(maxDistance, dist + 1);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return maxDistance;\n    }\n}\npython```\n\nThis code initializes the BFS from the start position 'S', checks each direction possible based on the type of wire at the current position, and enqueues new positions to be processed while updating the maximum distance found. Note that the connection rules are provided as part of the directions dictionary, which facilitates the validation of valid moves based on the wire's orientation and connection rules."},"task2":{"userCode":"using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApp1\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Task2();\n        }\n\n        private static void Task2()\n        {\n            string[] input1 =\n            {\n                \".|.\\\\.\",\n                \".....\",\n                \".....\",\n                \".-.|.\",\n                \".\\\\./.\"\n            };\n\n            string[] input2 =\n            {\n                \"...\\\\.\",\n                \".-..\\\\\",\n                \".|./.\",\n                \".-.|.\",\n                \".\\\\./.\"\n            };\n\n            string[] input3 = File.ReadAllLines(\"big-input-2.txt\");\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Total cells touched by light: \" + SimulateLightPath(input1));\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Total cells touched by light: \" + SimulateLightPath(input2));\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Total cells touched by light: \" + SimulateLightPath(input3));\n        }\n\n        private static int SimulateLightPath(string[] grid)\n        {\n            var yMax = grid.Length - 1;\n            var xMax = grid[0].Length - 1;\n\n            // dir: 0 = right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up\n            var touchedCells = new HashSet<(int, int)>();

It will handle directional changes and splitting and manage the recursive nature of these splits.\n\nMain Logic: This will initialize the grid from a file, start the light beam's journey, and manage the overall process to ensure every part of the beam's path is calculated correctly.\n\nOutput the Result: Finally, the program will calculate the total number of unique spaces the light beam has passed through.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\npython```\ndef traverse_grid(grid, x, y, direction, visited):\n    max_x, max_y = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    if not (0 <= x < max_x and 0 <= y < max_y):\n        return set()\n    if (x, y, direction) in visited:\n        return set()\n    \n    visited.add((x, y, direction))\n    result = set([(x, y)])\n    current_cell = grid[x][y]\n    \n    if current_cell == \".\":\n        if direction == 'right':\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y + 1, 'right', visited)\n        elif direction == 'left':\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y -

A group of people placed some\n  mirrors and splitters in order to keep the light to themselves and to prevent other homes from profiting\n  from your light source. Now you want to find out how many homes are left being illuminated. The\n  objects look like this:\n  • \"\" is a mirror which redirects:– incoming light from the top to the right and vice versa.– incoming light from the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n  • \"/\" is a mirror which redirects:– incoming light from the top to the left and vice versa.– incoming light from the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n  • \"|\" is a light splitter which:– splits/redirects incoming light from the left or right in both the top and bottom direction.– lets light pass through which is coming from the top or bottom.\n  • \"-\" is a light splitter which:– splits/redirects incoming light from the top or bottom in both the left and right direction.– lets light pass through which is coming from the left or right.\n  • \".\" is empty space where all light passes through from every direction.\n  Note that the light beam always enters from the top left and goes in the right direction. Also, you\n  can see in the example below, that beams can form loops.\n\n Task: The task is to get the number of homes which got illuminated by the original light beam. In the\n example above you can see that the beam which started from the top left corner illuminated all fields\n which are colored gray. The number of illuminated homes in this example equals to 15\n\n example input:\n  .|..\n  .....\n  .....\n  .-.|.\n  ../.\n  Expected output: 15","responseGPT":"To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of light through a grid that contains mirrors, splitters, and open spaces. The light starts from the top left corner and can change direction based on the objects it encounters. We'll simulate this in Java by following these steps:\n\nInitialize the Grid: Represent the grid as a 2D array where each element is a character from the given input (mirrors, splitters, or open spaces).\n\nDefine Light Movement: Depending on the type of object the light hits, determine the new direction of the light:\n\n\"\\\": Mirror that redirects the light from top to right, right to top, bottom to left, and left to bottom.\n\"/\": Mirror that redirects the light from top to left, left to top, bottom to right, and right to bottom.\n\"|\": Splitter that redirects light coming from left or right to both top and bottom directions and lets light pass through top/bottom.\n\"-\": Splitter that redirects light coming from top or bottom to both left and right directions and lets light pass through left/right.\n\".\": Open space where light passes through in the same direction.\nSimulate Light Propagation: Starting from the top left corner, use a loop to propagate the light through the grid. Use a helper function to get the new direction of the light after hitting an object.\n\nTrack Illumination: Use a boolean array to mark grid cells that are illuminated. This ensures you do not count a cell more than once and helps prevent infinite loops in cases where light might start looping.\n\nCount Illuminated Homes: Once the simulation is complete, count all cells marked as illuminated.\n\nHere is a Java program to implement the solution:\n\npython```\npublic class LightIllumination {\n    static int[] dx = {0, 1, 0, -1}; // Directions: right, down, left, up\n    static int[] dy = {1, 0, -1, 0};\n\n    public static int countIlluminatedHomes(char[][] grid) {\n        int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;\n        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];\n        int count = 0;\n\n        // Start light from the top-left corner going right\n        int x = 0, y = 0, dir = 0; // right direction initially\n\n        while (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols) {\n            if (!visited[x][y]) {\n                visited[x][y] = true;\n                count++;\n            }\n\n            switch (grid[x][y]) {\n                case '\\\\':\n                    if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) // top-right or bottom-left\n                        dir = (dir + 1) % 4; // turn clockwise\n                    else\n                        dir = (dir + 3) % 4; // turn counter-clockwise\n                    break;\n                case '/':\n                    if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) // top-left or bottom-right\n                        dir = (dir + 3) % 4; // turn counter-clockwise\n                    else\n                        dir = (dir + 1) % 4; // turn clockwise\n                    break;\n                case '|':\n                    if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) // through pass top/bottom\n                        dir = dir;\n                    else // split left/right to up/down\n                        dir = dir % 2 == 1 ?

A group of people placed some\nmirrors and splitters in order to keep the light to themselves and to prevent other homes from profiting\nfrom your light source. Now you want to find out how many homes are left being illuminated. The\nobjects look like this:\n\n\n• \"\\\" is a mirror which redirects:\n– incoming light from the top to the right and vice versa.\n– incoming light from the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n\n• \"/\" is a mirror which redirects:\n– incoming light from the top to the left and vice versa.\n– incoming light from the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n\n• \"|\" is a light splitter which:\n– splits incoming light from the left or right in both the top and bottom direction.\n– lets light pass through which is coming from the top or bottom.\n\n• \"-\" is a light splitter which:\n– splits incoming light from the top or bottom in both the left and right direction.\n– lets light pass through which is coming from the left or right.\n\n• \".\" is empty space where all light passes through from every direction.\n\nNote that the light beam always enters from the top left and goes in the right direction. Also, you\ncan see in the example below, that beams can form loops.\n\nTask: The task is to get the number of homes which got illuminated by the original light beam. In the\nexample above you can see that the beam which started from the top left corner illuminated all fields\nwhich are colored gray. \n\nTASK DESCRIPTION END\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\n\n.|.\\.\n.....\n.....\n.-.|.\n.\\./.\nExpected output: 15\n\nThis is a valid trace for the example. The trace is marked with the following directional symbols: \n< left\n> right\n^ up\nV down\n\n>|<\\.\n.V.^.\n.V.^.\n<->|.\n.\\</.\n\nEXAMPLE 2:\n\n...\\.\n.-..\\\n.|./.\n.-.|.\n.\\./.\nExpected output: 22\n\nWrite a based on following parameters:\n- Write the method solve(String filename)\nThis method takes in a file \"src/Task1/big-input2.txt\"\nand returns the solution to the task (the number of illuminated fields)\n\n- Write a function that takes the input of src/Task1/big-input2.txt and convert it into a 2d char[][] that represents the grid.\nThe grid is represented in the following way: grid[row][column]\nThis grid will be then used for the rest of the functions/soltuion\n\n- Write a function that contain the core logic of the program. It should take char[][] grid as an input. It should loosely follow the following logic:\nStart at the top left row = 0, grid = 0, grid[row][column]\nKeep track of all current light sources.\nInitialize with only one light sources (starting top left row = 0, grid = 0, grid[row][column])\nTraverse left until a mirror or light splitter is reached.\nMirrors are defined as '\\', '/'\nlight splitters are defined as '|', '-'\nUpon reaching a mirror/light-splitter the light is then redirected/split based on the definition above.\nIf a mirror is reached update the direction and position of the light source\nif a splitter is reached delete the current light source and create 2 new ones with the updated position/direction.\nNote that the light might change direction and does not always traverse left!\n\n- Try to extract simple procedures in stand alone functions, use as many classes/functions as you see fit.","responseGPT":"Here's a structured approach to implement the light illumination problem in Java.
