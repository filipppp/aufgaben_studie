This script will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for grid traversal due to its layer-by-layer exploration, which ensures that you find the shortest path to each node from the source 'S'. Here are the steps to create the script:\n\nFind 'S' Position: Start by identifying the position of 'S' in the grid.\nDefine Connections: Define possible connections based on each type of wire symbol.\nBreadth-First Search (BFS): Implement BFS to traverse the grid starting from 'S'. Track the distances from 'S' to each node as you traverse.\nCalculate Maximum Distance: As you traverse, update the maximum distance encountered.\nHere's the implementation of the script:\n\npython```\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef parse_grid(grid):\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, cell in enumerate(row):\n            if cell == 'S':\n                return (i, j)  # return the position of 'S'\n\ndef bfs(grid, start):\n    # Directions for wires based on symbol types\n    connections = {\n        '|': [(1, 0), (-1, 0)],\n        '-': [(0, 1), (0, -1)],\n        'L': [(-1, 0), (0, 1)],\n        'J': [(-1, 0), (0, -1)],\n        'F': [(1, 0), (0, 1)],\n        '7': [(1, 0), (0, -1)],\n    }\n\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])  # (row, col, distance)\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start)\n    max_dist = 0\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()\n        current_symbol = grid[r][c]\n\n        if current_symbol in connections:\n            for dr, dc in connections[current_symbol]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    if grid[nr][nc] in connections and (-dr, -dc) in connections[grid[nr][nc]]:\n                        queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))\n                        visited.add((nr, nc))\n                        max_dist = max(max_dist, dist + 1)\n\n    return max_dist\n\ndef find_farthest_connection(grid):\n    start_position = parse_grid(grid)\n    return bfs(grid, start_position)\n\n# Test cases\ngrid1 = [\n    \".|F7.\",\n    \"LFJ|.\",\n    \"SJ.L7\",\n    \"|F--J\",\n    \"LJ.L.\"\n]\n\ngrid2 = [\n    \"-L|F7\",\n    \"7S-7|\",\n    \"L|7||\",\n    \"-L-J|\",\n    \"L|-JF\"\n]\n\nprint(find_farthest_connection(grid1))  # Expected output: 8\nprint(find_farthest_connection(grid2))  # Expected output: 4\npython```\n\nExplanation:\nparse_grid: Locates the starting point 'S' in the grid.\nbfs: Implements Breadth-First Search to traverse the grid. It uses the defined connections to check valid movements based on the type of wire at each grid cell.\nfind_farthest_connection: Orchestrates the grid parsing and BFS traversal to compute the farthest distance.\nYou can test this script with the provided grids or with additional cases to verify its correctness."

A group of people placed some\nmirrors and splitters in order to keep the light to themselves and to prevent other homes from profiting\nfrom your light source. Now you want to find out how many homes are left begin illuminated. The\nobjects look like this:\n• \"\\\" is a mirror which redirects:\n– incoming light from the top to the right and vice versa.\n– incoming light from the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n• \"/\" is a mirror which redirects:\n– incoming light from the top to the left and vice versa.\n– incoming light from the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n• \"|\" is a light splitter which:\n– splits incoming light from the left or right in both the top and bottom direction.\n– lets light pass through which is coming from the top or bottom.\n• \"-\" is a light splitter which:\n– splits incoming light from the top or bottom in both the left and right direction.\n– lets light pass through which is coming from the left or right.\n• \".\" is empty space where all light passes through from every direction.\nNote that the light beam always enters from the top left and moves to the right. Also, you can see in the example below, that\nbeams can form loops.\n\nTask: The task is to get the number of homes which got illuminated by the original light beam.

This script uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to propagate the light through the grid based on the properties of each object ('\\', '/', '|', '-', '.').

This approach is suitable because it systematically explores each possible path of light propagation.\nQueue Management: The script manages a queue to explore each direction light can take. When light hits a splitter, multiple new directions are added to the queue.\nUnique Count: The illuminated set is used to avoid counting the same cell multiple times for the same direction, ensuring accurate counting.\nOutput: Finally, we count only those cells which represent homes (denoted by '.') and were illuminated.\nThis script should correctly calculate the number of illuminated homes based on your requirements and constraints."

        "responseGPT": "To solve this problem, we'll write a Python program that simulates the propagation of light through the grid, accounting for how it interacts with various components (\"mirrors\" and \"splitters\") described in your prompt. The light starts from the top-left corner and moves initially to the right. The program needs to track the light's path, handle reflections and splitting according to the rules you've specified, and count the number of unique grid cells the light passes through until it either exits the grid or reaches a stable cycle.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to implement this:\n\nRead the Grid: Load the grid from a file, where each line corresponds to a row in the grid.\n\nSimulate the Light's Path: Initialize the starting position and direction of the light. Then, move the light according to the rules associated with each grid component it encounters:\n\n\"/\" and \"\\\" mirrors change the direction of the light.\n\"|\" and \"-\" splitters alter the path based on the direction from which the light approaches.\n\".\" allows the light to continue in its current direction.\nTracking: Use a set to keep track of all unique grid cells visited by the light to ensure that each cell is only counted once, even if the light passes through it multiple times.\n\nBoundary Conditions: Ensure the simulation stops if the light exits the bounds of the grid or potentially if it enters an infinite loop, although detecting loops can be complex.\n\nLet's start by writing this Python program.

This corrupted field is labeled as S.\n• \"S\" is the starting point which could be any of the symbols below.\n• \"|\" is a wire connecting vertically.\n• \"-\" is a wire connecting horizontally.\n• \"L\" is a wire connecting the top to the right and vice versa.\n• \"J\" is a wire connecting the top to the left and vice versa.\n• \"F\" is a wire connecting the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n• \"7\" is a wire connecting the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n• \".\" is empty space.\nAn example input circuit you would get for this challenge would look like this.

        "responseGPT": "To solve this problem in C#, you can implement a search algorithm that explores the connections in the grid starting from the position marked by 'S'. Given the complexity of the different wire types and their specific connection rules, a suitable approach would be to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This method works well here as it systematically explores all possible paths from the starting point 'S', calculating the distance until no further connections are possible.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown on how to implement this in C#:\n\nParse the Input Grid: Convert the textual representation of the grid into a more manageable form, like a 2D array.\n\nIdentify the Start Position 'S': Scan the grid to find the position of 'S'.\n\nDefine Connection Rules: Based on the given wire symbols ('|', '-', 'L', etc.), define the possible moves from any given position in the grid.\n\nBFS Implementation: From the starting position 'S', use BFS to explore all reachable nodes. Keep track of the maximum distance traveled from 'S' to any wire connection.\n\nCalculate the Farthest Distance: As BFS progresses, maintain a counter for the distance traveled from 'S' and update the maximum distance whenever a farther wire connection is reached.\n\nHere is how you could write this in C#:\n\npython```\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\npublic class CircuitFinder\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        string[] grid = new string[]\n        {\n            \".|F7.\",\n            \"LFJ|.\",\n            \"SJ.L7\",\n            \"|F--J\",\n            \"LJ.L.\"\n        };\n\n        Console.WriteLine(FindFarthestConnection(grid));\n    }\n\n    private static int FindFarthestConnection(string[] grid)\n    {\n        int rows = grid.Length;\n        int cols = grid[0].Length;\n        var directions = new Dictionary<char, List<(int, int)>>\n        {\n            ['|'] = new List<(int, int)> { (1, 0), (-1, 0) },\n            ['-'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, 1), (0, -1) },\n            ['L'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, 1), (-1, 0) },\n            ['J'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, -1), (-1, 0) },\n            ['F'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, 1), (1, 0) },\n            ['7'] = new List<(int, int)> { (0, -1), (1, 0) }\n        };\n\n        int startX = 0, startY = 0, maxDistance = 0;\n        bool foundStart = false;\n        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)\n        {\n            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)\n            {\n                if (grid[i][j] == 'S')\n                {\n                    startX = i;\n                    startY = j;\n                    foundStart = true;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (foundStart) break;\n        }\n\n        Queue<(int, int, int)> queue = new Queue<(int, int, int)>();\n        queue.Enqueue((startX, startY, 0));\n        var visited = new HashSet<(int, int)>();\n        visited.Add((startX, startY));\n\n        while (queue.Count > 0)\n        {\n            var (x, y, dist) = queue.Dequeue();\n            foreach (var direction in directions[grid[x][y]])\n            {\n                int newX = x + direction.Item1;\n                int newY = y + direction.Item2;\n                if (newX >= 0 && newX < rows && newY >= 0 && newY < cols && !visited.Contains((newX, newY)) && directions.ContainsKey(grid[newX][newY]))\n                {\n                    visited.Add((newX, newY));\n                    queue.Enqueue((newX, newY, dist + 1));\n                    maxDistance = Math.Max(maxDistance, dist + 1);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return maxDistance;\n    }\n}\npython```\n\nThis code initializes the BFS from the start position 'S', checks each direction possible based on the type of wire at the current position, and enqueues new positions to be processed while updating the maximum distance found.

It will handle directional changes and splitting and manage the recursive nature of these splits.\n\nMain Logic: This will initialize the grid from a file, start the light beam's journey, and manage the overall process to ensure every part of the beam's path is calculated correctly.\n\nOutput the Result: Finally, the program will calculate the total number of unique spaces the light beam has passed through.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\npython```\ndef traverse_grid(grid, x, y, direction, visited):\n    max_x, max_y = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    if not (0 <= x < max_x and 0 <= y < max_y):\n        return set()\n    if (x, y, direction) in visited:\n        return set()\n    \n    visited.add((x, y, direction))\n    result = set([(x, y)])\n    current_cell = grid[x][y]\n    \n    if current_cell == \".\":\n        if direction == 'right':\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y + 1, 'right', visited)\n        elif direction == 'left':\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y - 1, 'left', visited)\n        elif direction == 'up':\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x - 1, y, 'up', visited)\n        elif direction == 'down':\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x + 1, y, 'down', visited)\n            \n    elif current_cell == \"/\":\n        if direction in ['right', 'left']:\n            new_direction = 'down' if direction == 'right' else 'up'\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x + (1 if new_direction == 'down' else -1), y, new_direction, visited)\n        else:\n            new_direction = 'right' if direction == 'down' else 'left'\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y + (1 if new_direction == 'right' else -1), new_direction, visited)\n            \n    elif current_cell == \"\\\\\":\n        if direction in ['right', 'left']:\n            new_direction = 'up' if direction == 'right' else 'down'\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x + (-1 if new_direction == 'up' else 1), y, new_direction, visited)\n        else:\n            new_direction = 'left' if direction == 'down' else 'right'\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y + (-1 if new_direction == 'left' else 1), new_direction, visited)\n    \n    elif current_cell == \"|\":\n        if direction in ['right', 'left']:\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x - 1, y, 'up', visited)\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x + 1, y, 'down', visited)\n        else:\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y + 1, direction, visited)\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y - 1, direction, visited)\n            \n    elif current_cell == \"-\":\n        if direction in ['up', 'down']:\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y + 1, 'right', visited)\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x, y - 1, 'left', visited)\n        else:\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x + 1, y, direction, visited)\n            result |= traverse_grid(grid, x - 1, y, direction, visited)\n            \n    return result\n\ndef simulate_light_beam(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0\n    visited = set()\n    visited_spaces = traverse_grid(grid, 0, 0, 'right', visited)\n    return len(visited_spaces)\n\n# Example usage\ngrid = [\n    \".\\\\|-\",\n    \"/\\\\.\\\\\",\n    \"-|-.\"\n]\nprint(\"Number of spaces visited:\", simulate_light_beam(grid))\npython```\n\nIn this code:\n\nWe define the function traverse_grid that handles recursive traversal of the grid based on the light beam's current direction and position.\nThe function checks if the current cell (x, y) combined with the direction has been visited to avoid infinite loops.\nDifferent cases for mirrors, splitters, and pass-through logic are implemented based on the described behavior of each character.\nThe simulate_light_beam function initiates this process from the top-left corner of the grid moving right.\nYou can replace the grid in the simulate_light_beam call with any grid loaded from a file or defined directly in the code."

It also assumes the presence of exactly one 'S' symbol. If multiple 'S' symbols are expected, the logic should be adjusted accordingly."

        "promptUser": "solve this problem for me in java:\n \n problem description:\n You have a strong light source and want to use it to illuminate homes. A group of people placed some\n  mirrors and splitters in order to keep the light to themselves and to prevent other homes from profiting\n  from your light source. Now you want to find out how many homes are left being illuminated. The\n  objects look like this:\n  • \"\" is a mirror which redirects:– incoming light from the top to the right and vice versa.– incoming light from the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n  • \"/\" is a mirror which redirects:– incoming light from the top to the left and vice versa.– incoming light from the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n  • \"|\" is a light splitter which:– splits/redirects incoming light from the left or right in both the top and bottom direction.– lets light pass through which is coming from the top or bottom.\n  • \"-\" is a light splitter which:– splits/redirects incoming light from the top or bottom in both the left and right direction.– lets light pass through which is coming from the left or right.\n  • \".\" is empty space where all light passes through from every direction.\n  Note that the light beam always enters from the top left and goes in the right direction. Also, you\n  can see in the example below, that beams can form loops.\n\n Task: The task is to get the number of homes which got illuminated by the original light beam. In the\n example above you can see that the beam which started from the top left corner illuminated all fields\n which are colored gray. The number of illuminated homes in this example equals to 15\n\n example input:\n  .|..\n  .....\n  .....\n  .-.|.\n  ../.\n  Expected output: 15",
        "responseGPT": "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of light through a grid that contains mirrors, splitters, and open spaces. The light starts from the top left corner and can change direction based on the objects it encounters. We'll simulate this in Java by following these steps:\n\nInitialize the Grid: Represent the grid as a 2D array where each element is a character from the given input (mirrors, splitters, or open spaces).\n\nDefine Light Movement: Depending on the type of object the light hits, determine the new direction of the light:\n\n\"\\\": Mirror that redirects the light from top to right, right to top, bottom to left, and left to bottom.\n\"/\": Mirror that redirects the light from top to left, left to top, bottom to right, and right to bottom.\n\"|\": Splitter that redirects light coming from left or right to both top and bottom directions and lets light pass through top/bottom.\n\"-\": Splitter that redirects light coming from top or bottom to both left and right directions and lets light pass through left/right.\n\".\": Open space where light passes through in the same direction.\nSimulate Light Propagation: Starting from the top left corner, use a loop to propagate the light through the grid. Use a helper function to get the new direction of the light after hitting an object.\n\nTrack Illumination: Use a boolean array to mark grid cells that are illuminated. This ensures you do not count a cell more than once and helps prevent infinite loops in cases where light might start looping.\n\nCount Illuminated Homes: Once the simulation is complete, count all cells marked as illuminated.\n\nHere is a Java program to implement the solution:\n\npython```\npublic class LightIllumination {\n    static int[] dx = {0, 1, 0, -1}; // Directions: right, down, left, up\n    static int[] dy = {1, 0, -1, 0};\n\n    public static int countIlluminatedHomes(char[][] grid) {\n        int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;\n        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];\n        int count = 0;\n\n        // Start light from the top-left corner going right\n        int x = 0, y = 0, dir = 0; // right direction initially\n\n        while (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols) {\n            if (!visited[x][y]) {\n                visited[x][y] = true;\n                count++;\n            }\n\n            switch (grid[x][y]) {\n                case '\\\\':\n                    if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) // top-right or bottom-left\n                        dir = (dir + 1) % 4; // turn clockwise\n                    else\n                        dir = (dir + 3) % 4; // turn counter-clockwise\n                    break;\n                case '/':\n                    if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) // top-left or bottom-right\n                        dir = (dir + 3) % 4; // turn counter-clockwise\n                    else\n                        dir = (dir + 1) % 4; // turn clockwise\n                    break;\n                case '|':\n                    if (dir == 0 || dir == 2) // through pass top/bottom\n                        dir = dir;\n                    else // split left/right to up/down\n                        dir = dir % 2 == 1 ?

This corrupted field is labeled as S.\n\n\n• \"S\" is the starting point which could be any of the symbols below.\n• \"|\" is a wire connecting vertically.\n• \"-\" is a wire connecting horizontally.\n• \"L\" is a wire connecting the top to the right and vice versa.\n• \"J\" is a wire connecting the top to the left and vice versa.\n• \"F\" is a wire connecting the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n• \"7\" is a wire connecting the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n• \".\" is empty space\n\n\nAn example input circuit you would get for this challenge would look like this. Notice, that the whole\ngrid contains only ONE big circuit and therefore only ONE loop. The input grid can also contain\nmultiple connections which are not connected to the circuit. This means every connection field has\nonly two other connecting parts.\n\nTask: The task is to find the farthest connection from the starting point S. In the example above the\ngray field with the symbol 7 is the farthest connection with distance 8.

Solve it in java.\n\nThis is your task description:\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION START\n\nYou have a strong light source and want to use it to illuminate homes. A group of people placed some\nmirrors and splitters in order to keep the light to themselves and to prevent other homes from profiting\nfrom your light source. Now you want to find out how many homes are left being illuminated. The\nobjects look like this:\n\n\n• \"\\\" is a mirror which redirects:\n– incoming light from the top to the right and vice versa.\n– incoming light from the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n\n• \"/\" is a mirror which redirects:\n– incoming light from the top to the left and vice versa.\n– incoming light from the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n\n• \"|\" is a light splitter which:\n– splits incoming light from the left or right in both the top and bottom direction.\n– lets light pass through which is coming from the top or bottom.\n\n• \"-\" is a light splitter which:\n– splits incoming light from the top or bottom in both the left and right direction.\n– lets light pass through which is coming from the left or right.\n\n• \".\" is empty space where all light passes through from every direction.\n\nNote that the light beam always enters from the top left and goes in the right direction. Also, you\ncan see in the example below, that beams can form loops.\n\nTask: The task is to get the number of homes which got illuminated by the original light beam. In the\nexample above you can see that the beam which started from the top left corner illuminated all fields\nwhich are colored gray. \n\nTASK DESCRIPTION END\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\n\n.|.\\.\n.....\n.....\n.-.|.\n.\\./.\nExpected output: 15\n\nThis is a valid trace for the example. The trace is marked with the following directional symbols: \n< left\n> right\n^ up\nV down\n\n>|<\\.\n.V.^.\n.V.^.\n<->|.\n.\\</.\n\nEXAMPLE 2:\n\n...\\.\n.-..\\\n.|./.\n.-.|.\n.\\./.\nExpected output: 22\n\nWrite a based on following parameters:\n- Write the method solve(String filename)\nThis method takes in a file \"src/Task1/big-input2.txt\"\nand returns the solution to the task (the number of illuminated fields)\n\n- Write a function that takes the input of src/Task1/big-input2.txt and convert it into a 2d char[][] that represents the grid.\nThe grid is represented in the following way: grid[row][column]\nThis grid will be then used for the rest of the functions/soltuion\n\n- Write a function that contain the core logic of the program. It should take char[][] grid as an input. It should loosely follow the following logic:\nStart at the top left row = 0, grid = 0, grid[row][column]\nKeep track of all current light sources.\nInitialize with only one light sources (starting top left row = 0, grid = 0, grid[row][column])\nTraverse left until a mirror or light splitter is reached.\nMirrors are defined as '\\', '/'\nlight splitters are defined as '|', '-'\nUpon reaching a mirror/light-splitter the light is then redirected/split based on the definition above.\nIf a mirror is reached update the direction and position of the light source\nif a splitter is reached delete the current light source and create 2 new ones with the updated position/direction.\nNote that the light might change direction and does not always traverse left!\n\n- Try to extract simple procedures in stand alone functions, use as many classes/functions as you see fit.",

We need to compute the number of cells illuminated by this beam as it travels and potentially splits across the grid.\n\nHere's a TypeScript function that implements this simulation:\n\npython```\nfunction countIlluminated(grid: string[]): number {\n    const numRows = grid.length;\n    const numCols = grid[0].length;\n    const illuminated = new Set<string>();\n\n    // Directions: right, down, left, up\n    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];\n    // Reflects for '/' and '\\' mirrors respectively.\n    const slashReflect = [3, 2, 1, 0]; // From top, from right, from bottom, from left\n    const backslashReflect = [1, 0, 3, 2];\n\n    // Traverse the grid with the light\n    function traverseLight(x: number, y: number, direction: number) {\n        while (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < numRows && y < numCols) {\n            illuminated.add(`${x},${y}`);\n            let cell = grid[x][y];\n\n            switch (cell) {\n                case '.':\n                    // Light continues in the same direction\n                    break;\n                case '/':\n                    // Reflect light based on the '/'\n                    direction = slashReflect[direction];\n                    break;\n                case '\\\\':\n                    // Reflect light based on the '\\'\n                    direction = backslashReflect[direction];\n                    break;\n                case '|':\n                    // Split light vertically\n                    if (direction === 0 || direction === 2) {\n                        // Coming from left or right, split up and down\n                        traverseLight(x - 1, y, 3);\n                        traverseLight(x + 1, y, 1);\n                        return; // Stop the current path\n                    }\n                    break;\n                case '-':\n                    // Split light horizontally\n                    if (direction === 1 || direction === 3) {\n                        // Coming from top or bottom, split left and right\n                        traverseLight(x, y - 1, 2);\n                        traverseLight(x, y + 1, 0);\n                        return; // Stop the current path\n                    }\n                    break;\n            }\n            // Move to the next cell\n            x += directions[direction][0];\n            y += directions[direction][1];\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Start the light from the top left corner going to the right\n    traverseLight(0, 0, 0);\n\n    return illuminated.size;\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst grid1 = ['.|.\\\\.', '.....', '.....', '.-.|.', '.\\\\./.'];\nconst grid2 = ['...\\\\.', '.-..\\\\', '.|./.', '.-.|.', '.\\\\./.'];\n\nconsole.log(countIlluminated(grid1)); // Expected output: 15\nconsole.log(countIlluminated(grid2)); // Expected output: 22\npython```\nThis function defines the behavior of light interaction with different objects on the grid. It uses recursion to handle light splitting, which continues until all paths are explored. The illuminated set keeps track of all unique positions the light visits, ensuring that we count each illuminated position exactly once."

You exported the design of the\ncircuit as an text file and saved it to your PC. After opening the file you see that one circuit field got\ncorrupted, but you are sure it was part of the circuit. This corrupted field is labeled as S.\n• \"S\" is the starting point which could be any of the symbols below.\n• \"|\" is a wire connecting vertically.\n• \"-\" is a wire connecting horizontally.\n• \"L\" is a wire connecting the top to the right and vice versa.\n• \"J\" is a wire connecting the top to the left and vice versa.\n• \"F\" is a wire connecting the bottom to the right and vice versa.\n• \"7\" is a wire connecting the bottom to the left and vice versa.\n• \".\" is empty space.\n\ntask is to find what the corrupted part is and how far the furthest part is away from the starting point. \n\nSolution (Provide a pseudo-code approach for a solution to the problem):\n-create a courser or safe courser coordinates which start at the s point. \n-look for the neighbors around the courser.\n-if to the right there is a J, 7, - go with your courser there and safe the direction you went in a first hop variable\n-else if to the top there is a |, F, 7 go with your courer there and safe the direction you went in a first hop variable\n-else if to the left there is a -, L, F go with your courser there and safe the direction you went in a first hop variable\n-else if to the bottom there is a |, L, J go with your courser there and safe the direction you went in a first hop variable\n-else throw an exception that the file is not working\n\n-iterate through the circuit in the manner discribed above and count the hops until you end up at the starting point S again. safe the direction of your last hop in a variable \n-output the hop count and predict the corrupted piece with the last hop and first hop variable to complete the circuit.\n\"\"\"´´´",
